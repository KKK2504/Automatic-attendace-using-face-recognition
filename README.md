# Face Recognition and Automated Attendance Marking in Python.

An OpenCV project which recognizes faces from consecutive frames from a live camera and thereafter compares this with encoded known faces provided to the system.
The program outputs corresponding label of the individual on the same live screen simultaneously adding the attendance details like name, time and date for the specific event to a .csv file which is used as the database here.
Applications of this project includes Contactless Authentication, Attendance Monitoring for Online Classes, Image Sorting, Mask Detection etc.
