# Face Recognition and Automated Attendance Marking in Python.

An OpenCV project which recognizes faces from consecutive frames from a live camera and thereafter compares this with encoded known faces provided to the system.
The program outputs corresponding label of the individual on the same live screen simultaneously adding the attendance details like name, time and date for the specific event to a .csv file which is used as the database here.
Applications of this project includes Contactless Authentication, Attendance Monitoring for Online Classes, Image Sorting, Mask Detection etc.

# Objectives
As online classes progress this is a growing need of the tutors to mark honest attendance for every session they take. No better optionb than face recognition. The program scans your face and marks attendance for the particular session

- The camera opens up with the program and scans the entire surface for faces which are similar to the already trained encoded faces
- The program records your attendance with the time stamp in a CSV file, used as the database here
- This also notifies if everyone attended the session or not
